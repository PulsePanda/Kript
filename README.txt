Kript is a Java based Encryption Library. Designed with small time applications 
in mind, Kript is perfect for chat clients or multiplayer connections for indie
games. Kript was designed with a LAN-style multiplayer in mind, where you don't 
want just any sniffer to see what's going on and interrupt, but isn't important 
enough to justify using a slower, more heavy duty encryption algorithm.

Because of the lightweight design of Kript, it works smoothly with almost any 

application. Simply plug in the .jar file, create the Kript object, and go to 
work. Each end handles itself flawlessly, and can handle almost any type of 
input to encrypt. Because of how fast and easy it is to use, this is great for 
small time programmers and game developers.
